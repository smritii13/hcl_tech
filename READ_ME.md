Retail Data Processing Hackathon — Loyalty Lens Use Case

1. Vision

Build an automated, reliable data ingestion and quality pipeline that transforms raw retail transactions into clean analytical tables enabling loyalty point accrual, RFM segmentation, High-Spender / At-Risk detection, and CLV Potential scoring.

2. Architecture Overview End-to-End Data Flow

Source CSV Files → Retail_data_source

Ingestion Layer (Python ETL) → raw tables

Data Quality Validation (Great Expectations) → Clean vs. bad_records

Transform Layer (SQL) → customers, transactions, transaction_items, loyalty_accounts

Segmentation & Scoring → RFM, High-Spender, At-Risk, CLV Potential

Serving Layer → Dashboards & Insights

4. Data Model Summary

customers

Stores basic customer information and identifies loyalty program members.

transactions

One row per retail purchase; linked to customers.

transaction_items

Line-level product information per transaction.

products

Product catalog for diversity/breadth scoring.

loyalty_accounts

Tracks loyalty points, tiers, and updates.

customer_segments

Stores RFM-based and behavior-based segments.

new_customer

Captures unidentified spends for future marketing follow-up.

bad_records

Logs failed rows from ingestion or quality checks.

5. Data Pipeline Components Ingestion

Python scripts load CSVs into raw tables.

Logs metadata such as file source, ingestion time.

Data Quality Validation

Example rules using Great Expectations:

Required fields present (transaction_id, timestamp, amount).

Valid email / phone patterns.

Numeric checks (amount >= 0).

Timestamp validity.

Failed rows go to bad_records with error_reason and raw payload.

Transformations

Standardize customers.

Derive aggregated metrics.

Build fact & dimension tables.

Compute loyalty points.

6. Loyalty Points Logic

Rule Example: 1 point per ₹10 spent.

Compute earned points per transaction.

Update loyalty_accounts with atomic upsert.

Insert an audit entry into loyalty_ledger.

7. Segmentation RFM Metrics

Recency: days since last transaction

Frequency: number of purchases in 12 months

Monetary: total spend in 12 months

Segments

High-Spenders: Top 10% monetary value

At-Risk: No purchase in 30+ days + positive points balance

8. CLV Potential Scoring (Optional Enhancement)

Features:

AOV Trajectory

Engagement Rate

Product Breadth / Diversity

Points Balance

Produces a 0–100 potential score ranking customers by future value.
